# asphoto
Sveltekit experiment / photo website to replace my somewhat tired and definitely too expensive smugmug site.
Continuing the vision of capturing little special moments, frozen in time

## Status
Under development (when alec gets time between many passions)

## Structure
Docker container running a simple Node.js server with a Sveltkit frontend. Static site mostly, aside from photo updates.
Bind-mount to a directory with the photo resouces (not git-tracked for space considerations) and config stuff (git-tracked)

## Notes
This is intended to be a sort of precursor to the combined development that will be used to stand up `moneytrees` (coming soon!)
